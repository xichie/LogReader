Resetting a TCP connection is the protocol equivalent of aborting a transaction in an application protocol. In this case, the reset was initiated by the peer, so the other endpoint is known as the 'peer'.\n\t\n\t* The 'preauth' prefix in the error message is a clue that the reset was not initiated by the client, but by the server. This is because the server initiates the connection and the client initiates the reset. The client initiates the reset by sending a RST segment to the server. The server initiates the reset by sending an ACK segment to the client with a value of 0 in the SYN and FIN bits. The client then closes the connection.<eoa>\n", "'system-auth'\n### Logs:input_userauth_request: invalid user redhat [preauth]\n\n### Reply: system-auth\n```\nFor more information on system-auth,
