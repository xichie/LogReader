However, this may not be a good indicator of the health of the system. It is important to look at the number of requests and the number of connections being handled by the system. If the number of requests is high and the number of connections is low, it may indicate that the system is overloaded. If the number of requests is low and the number of connections is high, it may indicate that the system is underutilized. It is also important to look at the response time for each request to ensure that it is within an acceptable range.\n\nThe system log can provide more information about the number of requests and the number of connections being handled by the system.
